                 As a computer science student I have learned many programming constructs and programming languages such as
                 Java, Scala, Python, C++, HTML and CSS. Undertaking various projects using these different languages have helped soldified
                 my foundation in these programming languages. I have worked on individual projects to improve my programming skills, as well
                 as team based projects in order to develop team working skills. You can read more about the projects I have undertaken in the projects tab.

                I have also been able to use these skills as well as develop new skills while working in the industry. These experiences have provided
                me valuable skills and knowledge that I will use throughout my career. You can read more about my experiences in the experiences tab.
